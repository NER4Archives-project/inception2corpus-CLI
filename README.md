# inception2corpus-CLI
A CLI for retrieving a corpus annotated with named entities from INCEpTION instance to an archived and reusable corpus in context of any NER project.

*This tool was created in the context of the NER4Archives project (INRIA/Archives nationales); it is adaptable and reusable for any other project under the terms of the [MIT license](./LICENSE)*.

The CLI launches a linear process, called a "pipeline", which executes the components in the following order:

- Fetch curated documents from INCEpTION instance (XMI - check state of document in Inception > "Monitoring" window);

![curated-doc](./documentation/curated_doc_inception.png)

- Re-tokenize curated documents;
- Convert XMI to CONLL files;
- Merge CONLL files in one;
- Provides a report containing statistics and metadata about the corpus;
- Reduce (get only sentences annotated and reject other) and serialize dataset in 2 (train/dev) and 3 sets (train/dev/test) according to a ratio defined by the user

At the end of the execution of the program, an `output_annotated_corpus folder/` is provided in the root tool's folder, for more details see this [section](#Output-folder-description).

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### MacOSx / Linux

1. In `./inception2corpus-CLI/` location, open a terminal

2. Check if Python 3.7 or higher is installed

```bash
python --version
```

if not, install it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3. Create a code environment with virtualenv and correct Python version

```bash
virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.7 venv
```

4. Activate this code environment

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

5. Finally, install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Windows

1. In `./inception2corpus-CLI/` location, open a terminal (powershell)

2. Check if Python 3.7 or higher is installed

```bash
python --version
```

if not, install it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

3. Create a code environment with virtualenv and correct Python version

```bash
py -m venv venv
```

4. Activate this code environment

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

5. Finally, install the required packages

```bash
pip install -r .\requirements.txt
```


## ‚ö†Ô∏è  Configuration before launch the tool

- Do not delete the `temp_files/` folder, leave it
- Do not delete the `i2c_lib/` folder, leave it
- Go to the [USER_VAR_ENV.yml](./USER_VAR_ENV.yml) file and fill it with the correct information.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

First activate (Cf. Installation section) code env and then follow:

**method 1)** In terminal, run: 

```bash
python inception2corpus.py
```

**method 2)** In terminal, run:

```bash
chmod +x inception2corpus.py
```

then 

```bash
./inception2corpus.py
```
